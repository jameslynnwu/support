# Plaid Support

## Just getting started?

Welcome to Plaid! We're excited to see what you build.

Check out our [**FAQ**][11] to learn more about Plaid's products and what we do. From there you can dig into our comprehensive [**technical documentation**][2]. There you'll find information about our API endpoints as well as code samples to help get you started. Our [**getting started**][12] guide will walk you through your first API requests. The [**help center**][14] will help answer many common integration questions and issues.

[**Plaid Link**][1] is the quickest way to get your app up-and-running with the API. Link is a drop-in module that handles credential validation, multi-factor authentication, and error handling for each institution that we supportâ€”all while keeping credentials from ever hitting your server.

## Running into an issue?

You'll find the answers to most questions in our [**docs**][2] and [**help center**][14]. If you're still stuck, [open a support ticket][15] and we'll get back to you promptly.

**Note:** Please do NOT include your API `secret` in a support request.
