# Plaid Support

## Just getting started?

Welcome to Plaid! We're excited to see what you build.

Check out our [**quickstart guide**][quickstart] to learn more about Plaid's products and jump-start your integration. From there you can dig into our [**technical documentation**][api-docs]. There you'll find comprehensive documentation for Link and our API endpoints as well as client library code samples to help get you started. The [**help center**][help-center] will help answer many common integration questions and issues.

[**Plaid Link**][link-blog-post] is the quickest way to get your app up-and-running with the API. Link is a drop-in module that handles credential validation, multi-factor authentication, and error handling for each institution that we supportâ€”all while keeping credentials from ever hitting your server.

## Running into an issue?

You'll find the answers to most questions in our [**quickstart**][quickstart], [**docs**][api-docs] and [**help center**][help-center].
